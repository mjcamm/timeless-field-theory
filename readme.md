# Timeless Photons: A New Physics Framework

## About Me

I'm Mitchell Camm, a software engineer with a lifelong passion for physics. I've always enjoyed reading books, and watching verious youtube channels like Veritasium and PBS Space Time.

I had an idea in March 2025 for a new theory of physics, I think I might be onto something interesting, but I don't know any physicists to help work on it with.

## About This Repository

This repository hosts my developing theory that proposes a fundamentally new way to conceptualize photons and their relationship to time. As someone from outside traditional academic physics, I've chosen an open-source approach to development, and invite collaboration of the core ideas.

### Why Open Source?

-Physics theories typically develop through academic channels. But I don't have access / nor time to pursue this through traditional avenues like universities.

-I'm very aware of my weaknesses and that I myself can not fully see to its end if there is actually something here. So the open source approach is hopefully a way where various people can contribute their own strengths to make this more robust than I could ever alone.

-I welcome any contributions through pull requests, issues, and discussions.

## The Core Insight

This theory addresses a fundamental conundrum in physics: **How can photons, which don't experience time according to relativity, interact with our time-bound universe?**

I propose a framework built around the foundation where photons exist in a genuinely timeless state, with radical implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and its relationship to classical physics.

## Genesis of the Theory

The spark of the idea formed in early 2025 after watching the following 2 videos:

1. In February 2025, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdBGQg0Bct8) which reminded me of the interesting quirk about photons and time dilation.

2. On March 14, 2025, a Veritasium video ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZ1Ez28C-A)) prompted me to question: How does something that doesn't itself experience time get experienced by others through the passage of time?

This apparent contradiction became the foundation for this theory.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains my working papers, mathematical formalisms, thought experiments, and potential experimental validations of the theory.

I acknowledge this physics theory is unconventional. But maybe, resolving the deepest paradoxes might require reframing of some of our most basic assumptions.
